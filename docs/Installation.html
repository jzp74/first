<div id="title">First Things First - Installation</div>

<p>Please follow these instructions and you&#39;ll have First Things First installed in no time.</p><h2>Prerequisites</h2><p>Ensure that your webserver supports the following packages:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> (You have to use PHP version 5.0 or newer). This application has been tested on the following versions:<ul><li>v5.2.x</li></ul></li><li><a href="http://www.mysql.org/">MySQL </a>(You have to use MySQL version 5.0 or newer). This application has been tested on the following versions:<ul><li>v5.0.19</li><li>v5.1.37</li><li>v5.5.20</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Installation procedure</h2><ul><li>Install PHP. Make sure the php5-mysql module is enabled in PHP. This module is usually enabled in the most common Windows distributions.</li><li>Install MySQL (your hosting provider usually has both PHP and MySQL software installed for you).</li><li><a href="download">Download</a> the latest release of FirstThingsFirst (zip format)</li><li>Upload the &#39;<em>firstthingsfirst</em>&#39; directory from the zipfile to your hosting provider.</li><li>Edit the file &#39;<em>localsettings.php</em>&#39; and change at least the following settings:<ul><li>date setting (firstthingsfirst_date_string). Choose European or US date setting.</li><li>table prefix (firstthingsfirst_db_table_prefix). I recommend using a table prefix at all times. The table prefix has to be a unique prefix (not used by a CMS or some other application).</li><li>admin password (firstthingsfirst_admin_passwd). Choose a new admin password. This will be the password for user &#39;<em>admin</em>&#39;.</li><li>database host name (firstthingsfirst_db_host). This is usually &#39;<em>localhome</em>&#39;.</li><li>database user name (firstthingsfirst_db_user). Make sure this is an existing (or new) database user (your hosting provider usually creates a database user for you)</li><li>database password (firstthingsfirst_db_passwd). Make sure this is the correct user password of firstthingsfirst_db_user. Your hosting provider has to give you this password.</li><li>database schema name (firstthingsfirst_db_schema). Make sure this is an existing (or new) database schema. Hosting providers usually don&#39;t give you privileges to create a new schema. This means your stuck with only one schema which you have to share with your CMS, blog and other applications.</li><li>full path name (firstthingsfirst_full_pathname). Set the full path name to your installation. This is usually something like &#39;/home/USER_NAME/firstthingsfirst&#39;.</li></ul></li><li>Open a browser and go the webadress of the location to which you copied the application. You will get a login screen. Login as user &#39;<em>admin</em>&#39; with your admin password.</li><li>If login is succesful, chances are that your installation was succesful. I recommend you to do the following just to be sure:<ul><li>Go to the following URL: http://www.YOURDOMAIN/LOCATION_OF_FIRSTTHINGSFIRST/test</li><li>You are presented with the testresults. If they are all green, your installation was definitely a success. If not, the problem usually has something to do with your database settings.</li></ul></li></ul><p>That&#39;s all!</p><p>As you can see this was really simple. Now you can start creating and using all kinds of lists. Have fun!</p><h2>Supported browsers</h2><p>This application has been tested on the following browsers:</p><ul><li>Internet Explorer 7, 8 and 9</li><li>Firefox 3 up to&nbsp;8</li><li>Chrome 4 up to 17</li></ul>
