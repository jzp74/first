<p>Please follow these instructions and you'll have First Things First upgraded in no time.</p>
<h1>Upgrade procedure</h1>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.jaspershome.org/firstthingsfirst/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=5">Download</a> the latest release of FirstThingsFirst (zip format)</li>
    <li>Dowload your <em>'localsettings.php'</em> from your hosting provider.</li>
    <li>Backup your database (very important!)</li>
    <li>Upload the '<em>firstthingsfirst</em>' directory from the zipfile to your hosting provider.</li>
    <li>Upload your local copy of <em>'localsettings.php'</em> to your hosting provider. Make sure that you add new settings to your version of <em>'localsettings.php'</em>. Refer to the paragraph below to see if new settings have been added to the <em>'localsettings.php'</em> of your new version.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>Run the release specific upgrade script (if present). You can find this script in the <em>'scripts'</em> directory. Refer to the paragraph below to see if you need to run an update script for your new version.</li>
    <li>Open a browser and go the webadress of the location to which you copied the application. You will get a login screen. Login as user '<em>admin</em>' with your admin password.</li>
    <li>If login is succesful, chances are that your installation was succesful. I recommend you to do the following just to be sure:
    <ul>
        <li>Go to the following URL: http://www.YOURDOMAIN/LOCATION_OF_FIRSTTHINGSFIRST/regressiontest.php</li>
        <li>Wait (several seconds).</li>
        <li>You are presented with the testresults. If they are all green, your installation was definitely a success. If not, the problem usually has something to do with your database settings.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>That's all!</p>
<p>As you can see this was really simple. Now you can start creating and using all kinds of lists. Have fun!</p>
