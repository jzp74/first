<div id="title">First Things First - Installation</div>

<p>Please follow these instructions and you'll have First Things First installed in no time.</p>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Ensure that your webserver supports the following packages:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> (You have to use PHP version 5.0 or newer). This application has been tested on the following versions:
    <ul>
        <li>v5.2.0</li>
        <li>v5.2.5</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mysql.org">MySQL </a>(You have to use MySQL version 5.0 or newer). This application has been tested on the following versions:
    <ul>
        <li>v4.1.11</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>v5.0.19</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h1>Installation procedure</h1>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.jaspershome.org/firstthingsfirst/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6&amp;Itemid=5">Download</a> the latest release of FirstThingsFirst (zip format)</li>
    <li>Upload the '<em>firstthingsfirst</em>' directory from the zipfile to your hosting provider.</li>
    <li>Edit the file '<em>localsettings.php</em>' and change at least the following settings:
    <ul>
        <li>date setting (firstthingsfirst_date_string). Choose European or US date setting.</li>
        <li>table prefix (firstthingsfirst_db_table_prefix). I recommend using a table prefix at all times. The table prefix has to be a unique prefix (not used by a CMS or some other application).</li>
        <li>admin password (firstthingsfirst_admin_passwd). Choose a new admin password. This will be the password for user '<em>admin</em>'.</li>
        <li>database host name (firstthingsfirst_db_host). This is usually '<em>localhome</em>'.</li>
        <li>database user name (firstthingsfirst_db_user).</li>
        <li>database password (firstthingsfirst_db_passwd).</li>
        <li>database schema name (firstthingsfirst_db_schema). Hosting providers usually don't give you privileges to create a new schema. This means your stuck with only one schema which you have to share with your CMS, blog and other applications.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Open a browser and go the webadress of the location to which you copied the application. You will get a login screen. Login as user '<em>admin</em>' with your admin password.</li>
    <li>If login is succesful, chances are that your installation was succesful. I recommend you to do the following just to be sure:
    <ul>
        <li>Go to the following URL: http://www.YOURDOMAIN/LOCATION_OF_FIRSTTHINGSFIRST/regressiontest.php</li>
        <li>Wait (several seconds).</li>
        <li>You are presented with the testresults. If they are all green, your installation was definitely a success. If not, the problem usually has something to do with your database settings.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>That's all!</p>
<p>As you can see this was really simple. Now you can start creating and using all kinds of lists. Have fun!</p>
